# Kubernetes Design Patterns

Key principles highlighted :-

- Optimization for Scalability: Modern applications should be optimized for scalability to handle varying workloads efficiently .

- Resiliency: Applications should be designed to be resilient, capable of recovering from failures and maintaining functionality .
- Pace of Change: Embracing the rapid pace of change is crucial, allowing applications to evolve quickly to meet user needs and market demands .
- Automation: Cloud-native platforms enable automation of various processes, enhancing efficiency and reducing manual intervention .
- Containerization: Containers are emphasized as the standard way of packaging and running distributed applications, promoting modularity and reusability .
- Clean Code Practices: The importance of clean code practices, domain-driven design, and microservices patterns is essential for effective implementation of cloud-native patterns .

## Core concepts of Kubernetes 
- Core Kubernetes Concepts: Fundamental concepts of Kubernetes, such as Pods, Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps, which are building blocks for creating and managing containerized applications .
- Designing Cloud-Native Applications: Importance of understanding new abstractions introduced by Kubernetes and how they enable the automation of distributed applications on cloud-native platforms .
- Principles and Patterns: The principles and patterns that are crucial for building applications that can be automated by cloud-native platforms like Kubernetes .
- Key Takeaways: A foundational understanding of Kubernetes concepts, principles, and patterns necessary for designing and implementing cloud-native applications effectively.

## Second: Tables

This is the second subsection.


Please, check [First: Images] subsection.

Please, check [this](#first-images) subsection.

| Index | Name |
| ----- | ---- |
| 0     | AAA  |
| 1     | BBB  |
| ...   | ...  |

Table: This is an example table.

## Third: Equations

Formula example: $\mu = \sum_{i=0}^{N} \frac{x_i}{N}$

Now, full size:

$$\mu = \sum_{i=0}^{N} \frac{x_i}{N}$$

And a code sample:

```rb
def hello_world
  puts "hello world!"
end

hello_world
```
